A kernel that scraps twitter handles of most influencial africans/leaders from some html pages and checks their popularity, social inclination and reach score based on their twitter data to determine if they're fit to partner with for the digital campaign.  
## Goal: 
* Identify influencers rank position from Twitter data. 


Directed links in social media could represent anything
from intimate friendships to common interests, or even
a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such
directed links determine the flow of information and
hence indicate a user’s influence on others—a concept
that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. . We make
several interesting observations. First, popular users
who have high indegree are not necessarily influential
in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second,
most influential users can hold significant influence over
a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort
such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that
these findings provide new insights for viral marketing
and suggest that topological measures such as indegree
alone reveals very little about the influence of a user
